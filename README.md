![Example Assembly](3D%20Printed%20Optomechanical%20Components/Full%20Optical%20Assemblies/Michelson%20Interferometer%20Assembly.png)

Attempting to design research quality 3d printed optomechanical/kinematic components as cheap as possible.
Will be updating with detailed assemblies, BOMs, and supplies needed for each component.
